# 🍕 Neko Pizza Billing System

A handcrafted, terminal-based pizza ordering experience written in Java.  
Simulates a retro billing system with customer KYC, itemized billing, randomized order ID, and fully formatted ASCII interfaces.

Built with **Java** and an unhealthy obsession with `System.out.format()` alignment.

This is Module_1 Master Project Solution for my **University's** OOPs Course
